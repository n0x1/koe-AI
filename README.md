# 声 koe AI 
Koe is a voice/text-based AI for assisting users with learning Japanese vocabulary, which is often very context-dependent. For example, the relationship between the speaker and listener, the time, regional dialect, and more can all drastically change what words are appropriate. Koe assists with this, providing the key vocabulary words and phrases after listening to your provided situation.
